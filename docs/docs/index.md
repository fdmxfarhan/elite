# Welcome to RCJ Soccer Sim!

The RCJ Soccer Simulation Challenge will be an additional championship held at the 2021 RoboCup Junior.
After a successful Demo competition in February, the next event will be
the official Qualification Tournaments in May 2021,
open for participation to any team that would like to register.

The simulator is based on [Webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots).
The associated [repository](https://github.com/RoboCupJuniorTC/rcj-soccer-sim)
provides both the "automatic referee" (which implements the
[Soccer Simulated Rules](rules.md))
as well as a sample team of robots with some basic simulated strategy.
